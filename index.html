            <h2 class="titles">UX stands for User Experience</h2>
            <h2 class="titles">UI stands for User Interface</h2><br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="main-content">
            <p class="paragraphs">UX focuses on ease of usability and the overall user experience. We strategize on
                wireframing and
                prototyping to ensure users can easily find what you need them to know and how your firm operates on
                receiving/informing clients. We find it critical to ensure user satisfaction meets expectations and
                excels by providing an enjoyable experience. Upon execution, we can also continue to work with you by
                adopting methods of collecting customer feedback to continue to ensure ease of usability.
            </p><br>
            <p class="paragraphs">UI works in hand with UX design by establishing a pleasant look and feel to your
                product. We can help
                with color schemes and typography to fit with your firms branding. Haven't developed a brand? No
                worries, we can also work with you to provide graphic and visual design along with branding skills to
                help you create a look that'll help you stand out. </p><br>
            <p class="paragraphs">UX and UI work together closely to ensure users are able to have an enjoyable
                experience when viewing
                your services and how they can receive help. </p><br><br>

            <!-- EXAMPLES -->

            <h2 class="titles">How do we help?</h2><br>
            <p class="paragraphs">Each case will vary on needs, fields of focus, and issues you'd like to address.
                Below, we'll show just
                some of the ways in which we can help provide your clients a pleasant experience. </p><br>

            <!-- Product Requirements -->
            <h4 class="uxsteps">1. Understanding your goals and product requirements</h4>
            <p class="paragraphs">We start off by getting to know your firm, lawyers, and the fields you cater to. We'd
                like to meet you with you to discuss your goals and what your needs are. Looking for more user
                engagement? More clients? Increased awareness of your product and services? We’ll also go through your
                product to see how it currently operates. We can also help determine your target market and competitors.
            </p><br>

            <!-- Site Map -->
            <h4 class="uxsteps">2. Site Maps</h4>
            <p class="paragraphs">Next we'll work on a sitemap to layout all the components and label accordingly for
                ease of usability. Site maps are incredibly important and constantly evolve based on users feedback and
                future updates. It's one of the most important steps in the UX process. We can help new clients find you
                easily and be able to see and understand the services you offer.</p><br>
            <h5 class="titles">Example of A Site Map</h5>
            <div class="whiteout"><img class="img-responsive sitemap" src="img/sitemap.jpg" alt="Image of a site map">
            </div><br><br>

            <!-- User Flow/Profiles -->
            <h4 class="uxsteps">3. Journey/User Flow and Profiles</h4>
            <p class="paragraphs">With help from the site map, we’ll also create a user map to see the natural flow of
                how users go through your product and what information they will encounter. We can also create user
                profiles; a general profile of your target market and users (example: first time client vs. returning
                client). This helps us to determine information architecture (determining where to place information on
                your product) to help new and returning clients find the information they need easily.</p><br>
            <h5 class="titles">Example of a User Flow Chart</h5>

                    alt="Image of a company conducting a userflow"></div><br>

            <!-- Visual Design/UI -->
            <h4 class="uxsteps">4. Visual Design</h4>
            <p class="paragraphs">Of course, your product needs to stand out visually and support your branding. We can
                help on the UI aspect with graphic design, logo development, color schemes, typography, etc. We'll help
                you give the look and feel you're going for to attract your users.</p><br>

            <!-- Customer Feedback -->
            <h4 class="uxsteps">5. Testing/Customer Feedback and Reports</h4>
            <p class="paragraphs">We will continue to work with you by adopting and gathering methods of customer
                feedback and continued testing to ensure you're product is consistently providing ease of use and stays
                on top of visual modern trends.</p><br>
